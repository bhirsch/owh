Versions, Naming Conventions
------------------------------
This installation profile is composed of several different Drupal projects. Projects developed and maintained by StarsWithStripes.org use the following naming conventions for versions: 
- 6.x (e.g. 6.15, 6.16) indicate the version of Drupal core
- X.x (e.g. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2; 2.0, 2.1, 2.2) indicate the version 
  of the O install profile. The number before the decimal
  increments with major releases, that is, when APIs change
  the user interface changes. The number after the decimal
  increments with minor changes, patches, minor bug fixes, etc.
- alpha means 'early development'. StarsWithStripes.org 
  uses alpha projects in websites participating in development
  new features or modules. 
- beta means 'ready for early adopters in prodction websites'. 
  The functionality seems solid. But major changes could be 
  on the horizon. This is not a stable release.
