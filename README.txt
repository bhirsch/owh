About the name "Project O" 
--------------------------
Project O was originally called "OWH" (pronounced "oh"), named
after the Obama White House. The project began when StarsWithStripes.Org
originally copied the Obama White House's website design for 
Massachusetts State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz. This fall We started calling 
the project "O", or "Drupal O", because OWH was confusing. On December 15, 2010
We received a letter from a lawyer requesting 600 Euros for use of the "Drupal"
trademark, so now the project is in seach of a new name. Now, we're simply calling it 
"Project O". But the installation profile lives on as owh.profile. Sorry for any
confusion.

Soon, the official home of the project and git repository for 
this install profile will live on drupal.org. Until then visit:
